# vanilla-js-spa-hub-mocha-chai-tests
This repository showcases a collection of my personal projects built using **Vanilla JavaScript** for creating **Single Page Applications (SPA)**. These projects demonstrate my skills in developing dynamic front-end applications, and I’ve included tests written with **Mocha** and **Chai** to ensure their functionality. 
## Projects Overview

The projects in this repository highlight my ability to:
- Develop **Single Page Applications (SPA)** using **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks)
- Implement core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX
- Write **unit tests** using **Mocha** and **Chai** to ensure code quality and functionality
- Use **Vanilla JS** for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces
- Focus on clean, modular, and testable code

I’m actively working on new projects and refining existing ones to showcase my growth as a developer.

## Technologies Used
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for building SPAs
- **Mocha** for running unit tests
- **Chai** for assertion library in tests
- **HTML** and **CSS** for front-end structure and styling
